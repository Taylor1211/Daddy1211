  <h2>The Barracuda is called 'Cuda' because it was invented into a new model made the 'Cuda' which basically became it's new name.There where three diffent types of Cuda's the hard top the fast back and plymouth. But in 1969 they wanted to increase the preformance of the car so they added a new mod kit and a new vinyl roof.The orginal 1969 383engine as upgrded to put out 330bhp bhp meaning how much torque is affecting the car. And finally before the year 1969 ended they came out with the 440 Super Commando V8 engine along with new "S" kits. </h2>
