  <h2>But there was also the "Charger Daytona" which was made because the 500 was not up to dodges standards. The Daytona was released the 13th of April 1969. The orders came in fast because soon there was 1,000 orders. They added an 18inch nose then the project for sure went green light in other words for the project was a go. The high tal wing which was thought to not be helpful actaully increased the overall speed of the Daytona.The Daytona came out with the most common engine 440Mag with an amazing 375hp(at least it was back then). This engine created 480 pounds of torque with an auto transmission, and a differential made by Chrysler. Only one Daytona was raced in the NASCAR league and came in 7th place.</h2>
